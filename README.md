## Overview

In the quest for developing my frontend skills I have completed another challenge Four card feature section, on this challenge I have been able to reinforce responsive layout skill with flexbox. This website is responsive on all devices, The project was built with HTML and CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
